",NULL,"<p>A new report released by the National Commission on Hunger, &ldquo;Freedom from Hunger: An Achievable Goal for the United States of America,&rdquo; posits a bold but believable assertion that we should and can end hunger in America. This report offers a number of sensible recommendations to address the nation&rsquo;s hunger crisis. It also provides a refreshing and compelling witness to successful bi-partisanship with representatives from across the political spectrum coming together to learn, discuss, and arrive at consensus.</p><p>With unanimous support from Commission members appointed by Republican and Democratic Congressional leadership, the report acknowledges the hunger problem in the U.S., affirms the critical role that the federal nutrition programs play in mitigating hunger, and offers recommendations to strengthen these existing programs by making them more effective and efficient and by testing a number of good ideas.&nbsp; While the report acknowledges that hunger is a product of larger structural problems like poverty, unemployment, and discrimination, the Commission&rsquo;s charge from Congress was to focus on how to improve the existing federal nutrition programs.&nbsp; Therefore, other important policies that can address poverty, employment, and wages were not considered.&nbsp;</p><p>As an organization dedicated to ending childhood hunger in the U.S., Share Our Strength strongly supports a number of recommendations that would dramatically improve the lives of hungry children. For example, the Commission recommends a series of changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly called the Food Stamp Program.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""">[i]</a> The report recognizes the critical role that SNAP plays in reducing hunger while recognizing that the program could do more. With 45 million participants, SNAP has the greatest reach among all the existing federal nutrition programs, making it an effective vehicle to reduce hunger. The report specifically recommends a pilot to test an increase in the SNAP benefit level from the Thrifty Food Plan to the Low Cost Food Plan, a more generous benefit. Independent evaluations have shown that increasing SNAP benefit levels significantly reduces hunger, especially among very low food secure households.&nbsp;</p><p>The report also includes policy prescriptions that would help connect hungry children to healthy meals during the summer months, a time of great need.&nbsp; Over the course of the school year, almost 22 million children get a free or reduced price lunch at school; however, only 4 million children get meals during the summer months, in large part because the Summer Food Service Program created to replace school meals during the summer months is outdated and difficult to administer. For example, children currently have to come to the meals in a structured, supervised setting and consume them on site.&nbsp; While this model works well for some children, the vast majority of children in need of summer meals do not live near a meal site or cannot access one because of extreme weather or violence in the community.&nbsp; The Commission draws on a number of previously evaluated demonstration projects to recommend additional options for feeding hungry kids during the summer months. It recommends allowing states to offer a summer EBT option where families receive a benefit to use at the grocery store. It also recommends allowing for non-congregate feeding in certain circumstances, so children can bring meals home or meals can be delivered to a child&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; As Congress takes up the reauthorization of the summer meals programs this year (in the Child Nutrition Reauthorization), these recommendations should be given the highest of priority.</p><p>Additionally, the Commission seeks to &ldquo;ensure that SNAP promotes and supports work.&rdquo;&nbsp; To be clear, this recommendation seeks to improve on existing systems within SNAP and does not recommend imposing new work requirements on program recipients. With clear connections among work, poverty, and hunger, SNAP functions to promote and support work through existing work requirements and employment and training services.&nbsp; The Commission rightly calls out the need for increased funding for workforce services and other work supports like transportation and child care to support SNAP participants as they seek employment.&nbsp; The current level of funding is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of service.&nbsp; Although the vast majority of SNAP participants are not expected to work (as they are children, seniors, individuals with disabilities) or are already working, the small percent of the SNAP caseload who are unemployed adults need the education, training, and job counseling to gain employment and advance in a career.&nbsp; The report also encourages greater flexibility in the use of these employment and training funds to support specific needs of different populations through subsidized employment, substance abuse and mental health treatment, and services to help prisoners as they re-enter society post-incarceration.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to these specific recommendations tied to SNAP and the Summer Food Service Program, the Commission recognizes the need to provide relief from the administrative burden (for both families and those organizations providing program services) often associated with program implementation and seeks greater coordination among various means-tested nutrition, education, medical, and social service programs.&nbsp; The call to action by the Commission is clear: Congress and the Executive Branch need to identify and implement policies that make it easier for families to access nutrition programs in a way that leads to improvements in health, earnings, and educational attainment. The playing field of federal means tested programs is so vast, adoption of this principle could find many paths.&nbsp; For those focused on hunger, the report affirms the importance of policies such as categorical eligibility in SNAP and direct certification for school meals, while encouraging Congress and USDA to embrace new ideas like simplifying out of school time programs for community organizations.</p><p>No language in the report recommends block granting SNAP or any other federal nutrition programs, and for good reason.&nbsp; The federal nutrition programs are set up to be countercyclical; they expand to meet increased need during down times and contract when the economy and the economic profile of Americans improves.&nbsp; Block granting means-tested programs results in states not having adequate resources during tough times, causing low-income individuals and families to lose access to critical anti-poverty programs</p><p>The Commission ends its series of recommendations with a call to create a White House Leadership Council to End Hunger which would include participation by both government and non-government representatives.&nbsp; This Council would be charged with developing a plan to end hunger in the United States and evaluate the progress to reaching this important goal.&nbsp; Reminiscent of other inter-agency and multi-sector bodies like the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the creation of this body would help ensure that the root causes of hunger in America were part of the dialogue and policy prescriptions and that the effort to end hunger in America transcended party and president.&nbsp; As the Commission asserts, we can end hunger in the U.S.&nbsp; But we need a plan.&nbsp; We need accountability. And we need to work together, to go beyond partisan politics, to share our strength, to ensure no child or individual goes hungry in America.</p><div>&nbsp;<hr /><div id=""edn1""><p><a href=""#_ednref1"" name=""_edn1"" title="""">[i]</a> Two USDA studies examined changes in the prevalence of very low food security during periods of increasing and declining SNAP benefits. The percentage of SNAP-recipient households with very low food security declined from 2008 to 2009 following the ARRA-mandated benefit increase, and then very low food security rose in subsequent years as inflation eroded the value of SNAP benefits. The changes in food security were proportionately similar in the two periods, suggesting that the associations reflect a cause-and-effect relationship. Taken together, results of the two studies suggest that increasing the maximum SNAP benefit by 10 percent ($69 per month for a family of four) would reduce the number of SNAP-recipient households with very low food security by about 22 percent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>",,,0,no kid hungry | share our strength | National Commission on Hunger

ÄºÄ˜",NULL,"<p>A milestone today on Capitol Hill: the Senate Committee on Agriculture passed the bipartisan &ldquo;Improving Child Integrity &amp; Access Act of 2016,&rdquo; the child nutrition reauthorization bill which includes important improvements to the summer meals and afterschool meals programs. &nbsp;</p><p>This is an important step to have achieved in our work to end childhood hunger in America.</p><p>The national summer meals program was created 40 years ago to help students get enough nutrition when school is out of session. When the program works well, it&rsquo;s a lifeline. Today, however, the program just doesn&rsquo;t reach a majority of kids in need; of the 22 million kids who receive a free or reduced-price school lunch, only 4 million are getting a summer meal. This legislation will help change that.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s five things you need to know about the Improving Child Integrity &amp; Access Act of 2016:</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp; It Improves The Way Communities Reach Kids During The Summer</strong></p><p>This bill contains the strongest improvements to how we feed kids during the summer in more than 40 years.</p><p>It does this through several key policies.</p><p>First, the bill includes the summer EBT program. Under this program, states would have the option to provide low-income families living in specific areas with a grocery store credit during the summer months to purchase nutritious foods, a model that has been proven to reduce the most severe forms of childhood hunger by up to one-third.</p><p>Second, the bill allows for offsite consumption of meals in hard-to reach communities or during times of public safety concerns or extreme weather. For example, when accessing a summer meal site is difficult or impossible for children, it would provide the option to deliver meals or allow children to leave a site with a meal for later.</p><p>Third, the bill includes a pilot program that gives the option for summer meals sites to offer a third meal to children, ensuring they receive three healthy meals a day during the summer months when they are most at risk of hunger.</p><p>Taken together, these provisions allow communities to overcome the most significant barriers that prevent them from reaching kids with the meals they need when they are out of school. They will help us go further, faster, in creating a nation where every hungry child gets the healthy food they need every day, regardless of their zip code or the time of year.</p><p><strong>2. It Streamlines Important Nutrition Programs</strong></p><p>The Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act streamlines the way the summer meals program and after-school meal programs work together, allowing communities to cut through red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy to better serve children in need throughout the year.</p><p><strong>3.It Stops Kids From Falling Into The Gap</strong></p><p>The Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act also helps to reach young children who often fall through the gaps in receiving the meals they need. By allowing children up to age 6 who are not enrolled in kindergarten to access the WIC program, the bill ensures the youngest and often most vulnerable children have access to the critical nutrition they need to grow up strong and ready to learn.</p><p><strong>4.It Helps Feed Kids In Child Care</strong></p><p>The Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act strengthens the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) by allowing child care centers and homes the option of providing an additional snack to kids who are in care for nine or more hours a day, as well as reducing paperwork and administrative burden for program providers. CACFP provides important health, nutrition, and educational services to children across the country and this provision will ensure kids are getting the healthy meals they need, every day.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;Next Steps: Continuing to Build Support in the Senate</strong></p><p>This is an important step in the process, but there is much more to do before this bill becomes a law. In the upcoming days and weeks, we will be hard at work to capitalize on this momentum in the full Senate as well as in the House of Representatives. This may be a tough road, especially in an election year, but the strong bipartisan support behind this bill is encouraging.</p><p>Hungry kids are counting on us. This helps ensure children get the nutrition they need, regardless of their zip code or the time of year. And that helps build a smarter, healthier, more productive generation and stronger nation.</p><p>Together, we need to keep momentum high as this bill moves through the House of Representatives and full Senate. <a href=""http://nokidhungry.org/senatetweets"">Take action today.</a>&nbsp;</p>",,,0,no kid hungry | CNR | Child Nutrition Reauthorization | summer meals | congress | advocacy

With few participating healthcare institutions to look to for guidance, MUSC had no way of knowing how many kids would take part when the program first stated. On the first day, MUSC fed 10 kids but the numbers gradually grew as word got out. By the third week, about 190 kids took part and by the end of the summer, MUSC served 2,385 meals through the two bustling cafeterias and by distributing meals at a clinic that treats kids with sickle cell anemia, cancer, blood disorders and other ailments.</p><p>MUSC recognized the prevalence of food insecurity in the Charleston, SC community and became aware that, despite programs like Summer Meals that target those most at risk, participation rates in such programs are low; in SC, only 22% of children who qualify for free or reduced priced lunch participate in Summer Meals. MUSC is also aware of the association between food insecurity and the rising cost of healthcare.&nbsp;Some estimates put&nbsp;the lack of access to healthy food at $130.5 billion in health care costs. Above all, MUSC recognizes that providing healthcare and improving well-being cannot be achieved if a person&rsquo;s basic needs aren&rsquo;t met.&nbsp;Seventy-five percent of households using the Lowcountry Foodbank have to choose between paying for food or paying for healthcare. MUSC and Sodexo were confident they could partner to find a way to participate in Summe Meals, and engage in the fight against hunger.</p><p>The feeding program that was created was self-guided; children followed a friendly purple octopus mascot through the hot line and to the cashiers, where the Sodexo staff ensured the children selected the correct combination of foods that met standardized nutritional criteria. This model allowed the children to select their meal like all the other customers, so they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; as kids getting a free lunch; &nbsp;they were just kids,&nbsp;eating lunch. They were also exposed to a variety of food. Jamaican chicken with jerk BBQ sauce, apricot-glazed turkey, and crispy baked tilapia were just some of the entrees from which the kids could choose.</p><p>Because hospitals are in a unique position to increase the number of people that they impact with the healthy nutritious food that they already serve every day, MUSC hopes to inspire other healthcare institutions to engage in the fight against hunger. With a No Kid Hungry Out of School Time Local Impact Grant, MUSC created an Implementation Guide <a href=""http://www.musc.edu/kids-eat-free"">www.musc.edu/kids-eat-free</a>, with the objective to encourage other health care institutions to use their existing infrastructure and the available hunger relief programs to improve population health by increasing access to nutritious meals for those most in need.</p>",,,0,no kid hungry | sodexo | south carolina | summer meals | Healthcare

The gap between what we know and what we do about the needs of children &ndash; when it comes to nutrition, and high-quality early education, mentoring, and health care just to name a few &ndash; is wider than ever.</p><p>According to the advocacy organization First Focus, the share of federal spending dedicated to children is just 8 percent of the federal budget, despite the fact that children are 25 percent of the population. Total spending on children has decreased 5 percent over the last two years.</p><p>In addition to the merits of investing in children, there are compelling reasons why coming together on behalf of children should have broad political appeal:</p><p>Our children are the most vulnerable and least responsible for the situation they are in.

And that starts with breakfast. But not every child in a classroom has the opportunity to start their school day with a full belly.</p><p>That&rsquo;s just unacceptable. But I&rsquo;m proud to work for a company that&rsquo;s doing something about it.</p><p>I joined Kellogg in 2013, the year the company launched <a href=""http://newsroom.kelloggcompany.com/2016-10-13-Kellogg-Company-Announces-Goal-To-Create-3-Billion-Better-Days-For-People-Around-The-World"">Breakfasts for Better Days</a> &ndash; our signature global cause platform. Late last year, we committed to creating 3 billion Better Days for people worldwide by 2025. This includes focusing our collective efforts toward our commitment to ending childhood hunger and making sure that adequate nourishment gets to families in need.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that at Kellogg, we know breakfast! And our team is keenly aware of the importance of starting the day right with breakfast at school. The Specialty Channels business I lead is responsible for making our products available in locations like schools, cafeterias, hospitals, hotels, vending machines, convenience stores, airports and more.</p><p>Earlier this week, I spoke at an anti-hunger policy conference about the importance of expanding school breakfast programs. School breakfast is linked to a number of benefits beyond the obvious nutritional and food security advantages. For example, there is considerable evidence that school breakfast participation leads to better classroom participation. And in a recently <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlfyvn8jZg"">created video</a> highlighting the fact that 1 in 5 kids go to school on an empty stomach, kids referred to hunger as a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; &ndash; something that definitely shouldn&rsquo;t be part of their school day.</p><p>In short, school breakfast is a key tool in helping to reduce childhood hunger and has the potential to have life-long positive impacts for all children, but especially those children in at-risk communities who face childhood hunger. Yet too many low-income children don&rsquo;t have adequate access to school breakfast programs. In fact, according to the most recent research, for every 100 low-income kids that received school lunch in the U.S. last year, only 56 participated in school breakfast.&nbsp; We need to close this gap.</p><p>To address this, Kellogg &ndash; with the help of partners like No Kid Hungry &ndash; has encouraged schools to implement &ldquo;breakfast after the bell&rdquo; strategies such as serving breakfast in the classroom or grab-and-go meals in an effort to make school breakfast more accessible, thus improving child nutrition and spurring academic achievement.</p><p>Over the past several years, Kellogg has helped our partners in the U.S. bring school breakfasts to nearly 150,000 additional low-income children. And together, we&rsquo;ve provided nearly 22 million additional breakfasts from 2009 through the end of the 2015-2016 school year.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not enough. We can do more. And we can&rsquo;t do it alone.</p><p>You can help. Every time you purchase a specifically marked box of Kellogg&rsquo;s cereal that says <a href=""http://give.kelloggs.com/en_US/home.html"">Give A Child Breakfast</a>, Kellogg will donate 1 percent of the proceeds to No Kid Hungry to help expand school breakfast programs across the U.S. And, you can even take it a step further by making a donation to No Kid Hungry by visiting <a href=""http://www.nokidhungry.org/Kellogg"">www.nokidhungry.org/Kellogg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a global food company, we will continue to be a leading advocate to fight hunger and feed the potential of all people, especially the most vulnerable among us. And together, we can create better days for kids across the country.</p>",,,0,breakfast | Kellogg Company

",NULL,"<p>It can be frustrating at times that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world millions of people are going to bed hungry every night. We produce enough food to feed every person, yet not everyone has access to it. On college campuses in particular, hunger is becoming more and more prevalent, but less visible.</p><p>As an undergraduate student at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) I have had the opportunity to research and advocate on behalf of college food insecurity issues.</p><p>After completing a pilot study looking at food insecurity among students on campus and spending time as a No Kid Hungry Youth Ambassador at End Hunger CT!, I recently completed a larger study on food insecurity on my campus by surveying graduate and undergraduate students. What I found was shocking.</p><p>We found that 25% of students were facing food insecurity issues, and 8% of those students were going hungry, skipping meals, and cutting the size of their meals. This number is much higher than typical rate in New Hampshire.</p><p>With the support of the administration at UNH and New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan, we created a task force to look for solutions to end college hunger here.</p><p>This fall, UNH launched a program to provide free meals in the dining hall for students who cannot afford healthy, nutritious food. This program is called &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/2016/11/swipe-it-forward"">Swipe It Forward</a>&rdquo;, in which staff, faculty, and students can donate meal swipes to for fellow students in need.</p><p>The hope is that this program will create a conversation on campus around food insecurity and hunger. Many students are struggling and do not want to admit it or seek help due to stigma. Not being able to afford food is not something to be ashamed of, I hope this program helps students realize that they are not alone and there are resources to help.</p><p>Today, UNH is one step closer to becoming a hunger free campus. I will forever be grateful for my university&rsquo;s administration for not only recognizing that food insecurity is an issue on our campus, but for committing to solve this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am more hopeful now then ever before that one day the United States will be a hunger free country. We, as millennials, have the power to make a real difference so long as we are willing to speak up. When I started this project I never dreamed the response it would get or the administrative changes that would come from it. UNH is not alone; food pantries on college campuses have been starting up all around the country and more research is coming out on this issue everyday. If this experience has taught me anything it is the power of passionate advocacy. One person can really make a difference &ndash; with hard work and determination the impossible becomes possible.</p><p>If you are a college student, start the conversation with your administration about what they can do to help students. Even the smallest of changes can be instrumental to the lives of fellow students. Lets end food insecurity on college campuses and ensure that all students have the opportunities to be successful in school and into the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generation No Kid Hungry and the Youth Ambassador program are made possible by the support of the Sodexo Stop Hunger Foundation.&nbsp;</p>",,,0,college hunger; University of New Hampshire; UNH; youth engagement; youth ambassadors; connecticut; generation no kid hungry

The people who lived upstairs could smell the rotting food through the vents, so my landlord removed and replaced the fridge while I was away.</p><p>I came back to that new fridge, this foreign, barren object in the heart of my kitchen. I opened the door to both fridge and freezer empty and just stood there, staring. All the food I had carefully budgeted for, prepped and frozen was gone. Meals for weeks were gone. The meager amount of food I had acquired and saved &ndash; root vegetables, onions, pickles, broth &ndash; gone. All I could see was that barren fridge, imagining what should be in there.</p><p>Stocking up again at the grocery store was financially not an option.</p><p>I opened my small cupboard and assessed what I had left, how I could make it work. I devised a plan where I would eat generally one large meal after work each day, mostly oatmeal, spices and a canned vegetable. I ate this one meal for days.</p><p>Working with No Kid Hungry on <a href=""https://cookingmatters.org/"">our nutrition education programs</a> in Denver, I saw many manifestations of food insecurity through our courses and tours. Until this moment in my life, however, I did not understand the powerlessness and shame of not being able to provide food.</p><p>At work, I told the story of the broken fridge, the poor neighbors enduring the smell and my replacement fridge. It was the light-hearted version, highlighting a minor inconvenience &ndash; not the desperate truth.</p><p>One coworker could hear the truth in it, the pangs of hunger that had become part of my daily life. This coworker had grown up knowing hunger, and has made it her life&rsquo;s passion to ensure that families in our community have the food they need. She could see exactly how what that new, empty fridge equated to my empty stomach.</p><p>The next day, I came into work and there were two bags of groceries at my desk, plus another bag in the freezer. I could not believe it. She came over and briefly mentioned that she &lsquo;just wanted to make sure I was taken care of&rsquo;. It did not hit me until she walked away what a difference she had made in my life. It would now be possible to focus on ANYTHING else besides food, without calculating dollars and food rations, without the continuous worry.</p><p>That day, she demonstrated one of the most important things there is: providing for those in need, when they need it most so that they can live their lives. Her kindness and generosity allowed me to feel the relief of the work we do. After carrying the groceries to my car that day, I cried. I cried tears of frustration, gratitude and relief. I cried wondering why I couldn&rsquo;t provide for myself. I cried thinking of those who couldn&rsquo;t do the same, or for their families. I cried out of liberation and happiness.</p><p>My co-worker didn&rsquo;t sit me down and force me to admit how desperate my food situation was, something I could barely express to myself. She just provided. She did not draw attention to her act of kindness. She just did it, for me, because I needed it. I walk by her desk every day and I cannot express here on paper, or to her in person, the amazing woman she is in my eyes, not only because of the difference she made to me that day, but also how many other people&rsquo;s lives she has managed to touch in this way.</p><p>Because of this, and because of her, I have a deeper understanding, respect and appreciation for the work that we do, and for the amazing people who contribute to it.</p>",,,0,NULL

James was a highly overweight 5<sup>th</sup> grader in a Cooking Matters Families class.&nbsp; My first reaction to meeting him was distress about his condition and concern for all the related obstacles that would undoubtedly, I thought, be in store for him.&nbsp; The very first day he told me that he loved to cook and that his favorite pastime was to bake elaborate cakes with multiple tiers and homemade fondant.&nbsp; Remember&mdash;he is in fifth grade.&nbsp; I heard this news with both delight and anguish.&nbsp; His mother, Sarah, sat in the corner sipping a can of coke through a straw.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t take part in the cooking, rather watched timidly from the side, trying to hide her soda on a shelf behind some dishware.&nbsp; Her shame was apparent.&nbsp; She mumbled a few times, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be drinking this&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; I reassured her that I drank coke too, sometimes.&nbsp; She told me that she liked getting prepackaged meals at the store because they were quick and easy and that every day her breakfast consisted of a bowl of sugary cereal.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m sure you might have guessed, a change occurred in these two individuals after a few classes.&nbsp; By the third class, Sarah began to help chop vegetables and said that she had made various recipes at home with the take home grocery bags.&nbsp; James started trying new fruits and vegetables that he hadn&rsquo;t been exposed to before and was cooking the recipes at home alongside his mother.&nbsp; In fact, he announced that he was going to be a chef when he grew up and own a restaurant, &lsquo;just like our Chef Allen.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the end of every class he would hang around to see if any there were any unclaimed vegetables to scoop up.&nbsp; He always asked first to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t taking away from any one else.&nbsp; I eagerly filled his bag up to the brim.&nbsp; Best of all, Sarah told me that she stopped eating sugary cereal for breakfast after our whole grain discussion and had begun buying different whole grain cereals and eating eggs in the mornings instead.</p><p>Sometimes when we don&rsquo;t see change happen, it can feel discouraging.&nbsp; Often we fail to remember that most change occurs so slowly that it is invisible to the human eye.&nbsp; But every so often, we get a glimpse of unmistakable progress, and that makes all the difference.&nbsp; I started out the class feeling sympathy for Sarah and James, but ultimately was impressed by their ability to redefine their attitude towards food and use their agency to evoke positive change in their lives. &nbsp;Time and time again I find that I learn just as much from my participants as they learn from me.&nbsp; If only we could all be so self-aware and have the courage to make such honest changes-- imagine the possibilities!</p>",,,0,no kid hungry | cooking matters | teachers | teaching | change

Food insecurity can look like a lot of different things: a completely empty pantry and no money in the budget to stock it; parents skipping a meal just to make sure their child has a plate full of food; families who, at the end of the month, are faced with making the unthinkable decision between paying rent and buying groceries.</p><p><strong>Families are on the Brink</strong></p><p>According to the USDA, 12.3 percent of all U.S. households have said they&rsquo;ve struggled to feed their family in the last year. This aligns with our recent findings from our 2017 <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/pdfs/HIOS_2017.pdf"">Hunger In Our Schools</a> report, which found that <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/families_on_the_brink_-_hunger_in_our_schools_micro_report.pdf"">two-thirds of low-income parents said a single unplanned expense would make it difficult to feed their families</a>.</p><p><strong>Food Insecurity and the No Kid Hungry Strategy</strong></p><p>The latest food insecurity numbers underscore the importance and urgency of No Kid Hungry&rsquo;s mission.</p><p>Federal nutrition programs play a critical role in making sure kids who struggle with hunger get the food they need. No Kid Hungry is hard at work to reach the 13 million children who live in food insecure homes so they get the nutrition they need to grow up smart, healthy and strong.</p><p>We know that when we connect kids to school breakfast and summer meals, we are closing the gap between kids who consistently have enough to eat and those who don&rsquo;t. We know that when we fight to protect SNAP, we are ensuring more kids get the food they need, regardless of where they live, the time of year or the time of day.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/blog/press-media-release/2017/09/share-our-strength%E2%80%99s-duke-storen-new-food-insecurity-numbers-usda""><em>For more information about the USDA&rsquo;s food insecurity numbers, please read this statement from Duke Storen, Senior Director at No Kid Hungry. </em></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",/pdfs/HIOS_2017.pdf | /sites/default/files/pdfs/families_on_the_brink_-_hunger_in_our_schools_micro_report.pdf,,0,2017 food insecurity | usda

The 2016-2017 school year marks the second of a three-year rollout of breakfast in the classroom to 339,000 elementary school students.</p><p>Two years ago, New York City had very low participation in their free school breakfast program because it was served before school started, in the cafeteria.

Breakfast truly powers their day.</p><p>No Kid Hungry, which convened a coalition of supporters to advocate for New York City to expand breakfast in the classroom two years ago, is proud to partner with the New York City Department of Education on a new advertising campaign to show just how powerful breakfast in the classroom can be.</p><p><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gR03v2kC_MA"" width=""560""></iframe></p><p>When we spoke to working families in New York City about this new program, their enthusiasm was evident. Parents told us how healthy food helps their kids focus and gives them energy for the day. But it&rsquo;s a struggle to get to school early to catch breakfast. Many families are juggling early morning or late night work hours and multiple school drop-offs, all at the mercy of public transportation. Parents thought breakfast in the classroom seemed like a smart solution, and liked that kids would start their day in a calmer and more controlled environment than a rowdy cafeteria.</p><p>With the support of our Partners and National Breakfast Sponsors, Citi and Kellogg, we&rsquo;ve translated that enthusiasm into ads featuring the voices of New York City schools students and the foods they enjoy while eating breakfast in the classroom.

Special guest retired Ravens Linebacker, Brad Jackson, attended the event and talked about how much eating breakfast every day helped him as a player &ndash; and how strongly it was encouraged by his team&rsquo;s nutrition coach.&nbsp; USDA Under Secretary Kevin Concannon expressed how important school breakfast is to the USDA&rsquo;s mission to make sure kids eat right. And our own David Sloan, No Kid Hungry Maryland Director, emceed the event, which featured sports and nutrition trivia questions. To win prizes, kids shouted out answers to questions like: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most important nutrient in milk?&rdquo; (Calcium!) and &ldquo;What Ravens quarterbacks played during the team&rsquo;s two Superbowl wins? (Trent Dilfer and Joe Flacco!)</p><p>For those who doubt the power of breakfast after the bell, all one needs to do is visit Franklin Middle School in Reisterstown in the morning.&nbsp; One minute, the halls are empty &mdash; and the next, hundreds of kids swarm into the cafeteria, quickly divide themselves by grade to pick up their grab and go breakfast, and then head to class.&nbsp; Stage directors at any Broadway show would be so lucky to have that kind of timing!</p><p>That these middle schoolers are pros at grab and go and is no wonder. They attend the school that beat out 231 other schools last year to win the Maryland Breakfast Challenge.&nbsp; Today, 1,300 Franklin students are eating breakfast each morning, because their school made breakfast a part of the school day, instead of serving it in the cafeteria before homerooms and classes start. &nbsp;Franklin Middle School shows how the timing of breakfast can mean the difference between kids getting breakfast so they can open their books ready to learn and kids sitting in class unable to focus on much else than their growling, empty bellies. &nbsp;</p><p>Across the school, breakfast after the bell has big fans. School counselor, Monifa Mears, tells us she likes it because it helps kids get down to the business of learning faster.</p><p>&ldquo;Kids aren&rsquo;t worried about coming late and not getting their breakfast. Breakfast is available after most of our busses are here, and if kids are even later, they can get a pass so they can get the later breakfast,&rdquo; Ms. Mears told No Kid Hungry. &ldquo;Teachers say they like it, because they see their students sooner, since the kids are eating in class with them. Before, all the kids had to eat in one place, in the cafeteria, until breakfast was done.&rdquo;</p><p>Head of the PE Department, Jaclyn Gordon, likes how grab and go makes it much easier to get good nutrition into growing bodies. &ldquo;I talk about nutrition when I&rsquo;m coaching cross country. I tell them that they need gas in their tanks to move their bodies and do what they need to do.&nbsp; A car needs gas, and so do you. I talk about nutrition to the kids when I&rsquo;m on cafeteria duty, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Franklin Middle School is just one example of the work No Kid Hungry is doing across the country to change the way schools serve breakfast. It's a big change, but once it's done, teachers love it, parents love it -- most importantly, kids are happier, healthier and more successful.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/20140317-jeffbridges-1656.jpg",1,no kid hungry | school breakfast | maryland | Grab and Go

Maybe when I was at Bouley slicing scallops that were so fresh they were still moving around the edges?&nbsp; Maybe working in Paris at L'Espadon and having the whole kitchen explode with the scent of black truffle when a single one was cut across the room?&nbsp; Maybe cooking with Mary, my better half, on the line at Annisa and having everything go right?

It feels so amazing to be part of something so much greater than yourself and to get inspired by all the people that dedicate so much time to this cause.</p><p><strong>If you were giving advice to a fellow chef looking to get involved in ending hunger, what would you tell them to do? What are the three most effective ways you think chefs can give back?</strong></p><p>Oftentimes, the hardest thing for a chef to spare, is time. I would say that getting involved in your local community is one way.&nbsp; Volunteer for a soup kitchen or get in touch with your local food activists and ask how you can help.&nbsp; It may be only once a year but it matters.&nbsp; Another great way to contribute to ending childhood hunger, is joining the No Kid Hungry campaign. The organization provides a multitude of ways to participate and connects you to other like-minded individuals.</p><p>Most importantly, remain aware.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t commit to something once a week then find a way to do something less often but don&rsquo;t feel like just because you don&rsquo;t have a ton of time you can&rsquo;t be of help.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite breakfast to jump-start the day?</strong></p><p>Smoked salmon, red onion, capers, cream cheese on an everything bagel.&nbsp; Classic but a staple favorite.</p><p><strong>When you were a kid, what was your favorite lunch item in your school cafeteria?</strong></p><p>Salisbury steak.&nbsp; I know, but we have actually been toying with a recipe for the tavern menu.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s one of your favorite recipes to make with your child? How do you involve your child in giving back?</strong></p><p>My older daughter just loves to help in any way she can.&nbsp; When we lived above the restaurant, she would come down and help me make gnocchi or roll pasta.&nbsp; Her reward was some freshly shucked oysters.&nbsp; They have been and remain her favorite food.</p><p><strong>Why did you become a chef? How long have you been cooking?</strong></p><p>I know that this is an answer often given, but my family was my greatest influence.&nbsp; Food and the romance and lore surrounding it were always woven into the fabric of my family.&nbsp; It was an integral part of every tradition and celebration.&nbsp; I knew that this was a love, something that I wanted to dedicate my life to.</p><p><strong>What do you cook or where do you eat on your day off?</strong></p><p>I have to be honest and I don&rsquo;t cook that much on my days off.&nbsp; I try and spend as much time with my girls as I can.&nbsp; We do family dinners and often my wife or Mom is cooking.&nbsp; When I do cook it is usually for a holiday or special occasion like Thanksgiving.&nbsp; On New Year&rsquo;s Day my daughter and I share a really decadent brunch that I make for us.&nbsp; Caviar, foie gras, lobster omelets.&nbsp; Other than that we eat a lot of pizza on Mondays.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/chef_lee_chizmar_-_photo_by_alison_conklin.jpg",1,no kid hungry | chef spotlight | Pennsylvania | chefs

What we didn&rsquo;t know was that Share Our Strength not only mobilized its national network to raise funds to address immediate needs, but also pledged to stay for the long term.</p><p>No Kid Hungry&rsquo;s work in New Orleans focuses on three key areas: school breakfast, summer meals, and nutrition education. In New Orleans, 1 in 4 kids struggles with hunger, a fact that applies to many communities across the country &ndash; including our home state&nbsp;of New York.</p><p>As a group, we&nbsp;had the opportunity to visit schools where breakfast participation exceeds the national average. New Orleans has one of the highest percentages of kids eating school breakfast in the country. It was immediately evident that these kids, who don&rsquo;t always know where their next meal is coming from, relied on these meals in the morning to be ready to learn. We also visited schools that in addition to breakfast, provided meals before the end of the school day. &nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;re in the culinary industry, so we&rsquo;re constantly surrounded by food; it&rsquo;s hard for us to imagine not knowing where our next meals will come from. But what we saw in New Orleans changed our understanding of hunger in America and what individuals can do to make a difference. On the trip, we met chefs who host fundraising dinners in their restaurants, restaurateurs who lead Taste of the Nation events, and peers who&nbsp;participate in advocacy &ndash; all to benefit No Kid Hungry&rsquo;s goals of&nbsp;ending childhood hunger in the US. In our role as culinary co-chairs of Night Out for No Kid Hungry, we helped to raise $1.6 million&nbsp;on Tuesday, which can help connect kids to 16 million meals.</p><p>Childhood hunger is a solvable problem. We urge our fellow members of the culinary community to do what they can to help make childhood hunger history.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Trip Participants</u></p><p>Karen Akunowicz, Myers+Chang, Boston, MA</p><p>Timon Balloo, SUGARCANE&nbsp;raw bar grill, Miami, FL</p><p>Eric Gabrynowicz, Restaurant North / Market North, Armonk, NY</p><p>Chad Gauss, The Food Market, Baltimore, MD</p><p>Joshua Henderson, Huxley Wallace Collective, Seattle, WA</p><p>Anita Lo, Annisa, New York City, NY</p><p>Rebecca Masson, Fluff Bake Bar, Houston, TX</p><p>Marjorie Meek-Bradley, Ripple and&nbsp;Smoked &amp;&nbsp;Stacked, Washington, DC</p><p>Julie Novak, The Greenhouse Tavern, Cleveland, OH</p><p>Kwame Onwuachi, The Shaw Bijou, Washington, DC</p><p>Ryan Pera, Agricole Hospitality, Houston, TX</p><p>Michael Paley, South Congress Hotel, Austin, TX</p><p>Eamon Rockey, Betony, New York City, NY</p><p>Sarah Simmons, Birds &amp; Bubbles, NYC, and Rise Bake Shop, Columbia SC</p><p>Arlin Smith, Big Tree Hospitality, Portland, ME</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/chef_trip_picture.jpg",1,no kid hungry | chefs | New Orleans

Those are big results for a personal fundraising effort. With the average bake sale for No Kid Hungry raising approximately $1000, what made this bake sale so successful in helping connect kids with 900,000 meals? Let&rsquo;s look at four tips learned from Gina Reardon, who was the organizer of this personal fundraising event.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Before we dive into the four tips, here&rsquo;s a little background on Gina and her bake sale. This was the third year Gina hosted a Bake Sale for No Kid Hungry. The first year raised $7500, last year raised over $27,000 and you already know what she&rsquo;s done this year. Gina is a professional caterer and is the owner of Catering By Design. With the help of&nbsp;brunch co-chair Nancy Smith, this year, the one day bake sale turned into a two-day culinary event with the community bake sale on Saturday and a country brunch and bloody mary smack down on Sunday. The country brunch included a band, over a dozen restaurants serving tasting plates, a silent and live auction and much more. &nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>It Takes A Village</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Gina deserves credit for hosting this bake sale, but she is always giving credit to those who came together to help her. And there are many who shared their strengths. She had someone help chair the culinary event, manage the silent auction and help with the event planning. There are many more ways, but the important thing is to know that Gina brought people together who contributed to not only baking for the bake sale but also marketing/PR, signage, flyers, interviews, deliveries and working that day. For the brunch, it took getting the tables, linens, signs, auction items, restaurants and bartenders, registration, marketing, celebrity MC, raffle tickets, and more. It's important to remember that it takes a village but doesn't happen without YOU.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Attention To Details</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">At the bake sale, Gina pointed out the little things she did to make everything look nice. There were bows and orange colored wrapping and every little thing reminded you this wasn&rsquo;t just brownies on a paper plate in a ZipLoc bag. It was a professional event with the tent, tables and tablecloths donated by a rental company, to the signs donated by a local sign company to the No Kid Hungry bracelets and buttons she had for everyone to wear when they checked out. Gina is a caterer by profession, so she makes it look easy to look good. From individually wrapping everything, to the bags people were given when making a purchase, to the aprons that every chef wore at the brunch, it looked professional. It was the little touches that made everyone say, &quot;What a great event!&quot; without even having to think why.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Goals</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">When Gina first started 3 years ago, she asked for suggestions from NKH on what her goal should be. They said the average for a bake sale was around $1000. Gina set her's for $3500 and crushed it. Last year she went bigger and crushed that. This year she went for the home run and it's yet to be seen how she'll end up for the year, but she&rsquo;s already crossed the $90,000 threshold with the culinary weekend. Gina shared that when she hosted her first bake sale, she knew she should have a goal. After knowing she was going to be one of the top fundraising teams last year, she set a more ambitious goal. This year, she set an audacious goal. When you don&rsquo;t have something to aim for, you never know where you are heading. Set a goal and then back into a plan to get there. Gina&rsquo;s plan came with a couple years of experience and connections that helped her expand her goal in a big way.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Start Early</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">While most people will see the $90,000 raised and the two-day culinary weekend, the event was being planned for a year. Gina, and her team, have been working on the culinary weekend since the bake sale last year. From planning to fundraising to getting more people on board, this was something that took a year of planning a preparation. Getting the ideal space to host the bake sale (in a walkable downtown shopping district and next to a residential family neighborhood) and the country brunch (an event space with room for food trucks out back and outdoor seating area) were just two things that had to be reserved well in advance. Coordinating getting the Mayor of KC to be a guest baker for the bake sale and then showing up to deliver his baked creations along with timing the local news to show up and do a segment on the bake sale with the Mayor and Gina, all took people and planning to make it happen. The earlier you can get on people&rsquo;s calendars, the more likely you are to get their commitment.</p><p><br />There are so many lessons we can learn from Gina about hosting a successful fundraising event for &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nokidhungry/"">No Kid Hungry</a>. &nbsp;By learning from what works, we can become more success ourselves.

Grant is a chef and the owner of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/T3Culinary/?rf=860846967284364"">T3 Culinary</a>, located in Antioch, Illinois, where he conducts in-home culinary instruction. He's a strong advocate of locally-sourced products and antibiotic-free, humanely-raised animals, in addition to his incredible commitment to feeding kids.</p><p>Grant writes:</p><p>I am a middle child of six, raised in southern California. In junior high school I first experienced other children who were not as fortunate as me and my siblings. We were not rich by any means but my mother always packed a well-rounded lunch for us.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/grant_tipton_0.png"" style=""float:left; height:216px; margin:5px; width:185px"" />I vividly remember there were a few classmates who were not as fortunate. They were on the lunch assistance program, which was a &quot;discounted hot lunch&quot;. Then there were some who couldn't even afford that. They usually would not come to the lunchroom or outside lunch area. They would sit by themselves, which I didn't understand until well into adulthood. I hadn't realized that they didn't have lunch and probably breakfast either. This stuck with me over the next 40+ years.</p><p>As a cook and food enthusiast I volunteered in the past to cook for food kitchens. However, these efforts were focused around a local community and specific meals such as lunch or dinner; they did not address children specifically or breakfast or afterschool.</p><p>Then I was introduced to No Kid Hungry. This is the kind of focus I feel is needed today. Being able to contribute what I can and promote as much as I can - on my social media sites and when doing food presentations - is very satisfying for me. Whenever I have the opportunity to talk food, I talk about supporting local businesses, buying good quality food and No Kid Hungry! I proudly display the No Kid Hungry logo on my chef&rsquo;s coats that I wear during public presentations.</p><p>Bottom line: my monthly contribution is the least I can do and I hope it is making an impact on the children who need it and inspires them to pay it forward when they can.</p><p>Thank you and the entire organization!<br />Grant</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/grant_tipton_0.png",1,no kid hungry | chefs

As a parent, that realization is heartbreaking.&nbsp;</p><p>As a father, I&rsquo;m passionate about making sure my kids have what they need to grow up strong, happy and healthy. My wife, Nancy, and I have three children, including an adopted daughter. When we first brought our daughter into our family, she was undernourished, but today she is well-fed, healthy and strong. I think all children should have that chance.</p><p>At Kellogg, we know that every hungry child deserves to start the day with the power of breakfast. Many families struggle to put enough food on the table. This Father&rsquo;s Day, one way to ease the burden on hard-working dads is to make sure their kids are able to get a healthy school breakfast. That&rsquo;s why we work with partners to find the very best ways to get this critical meal to hungry kids.</p><p>Think about what this meal means to a child in need. This meal allows kids to focus on school work, rather than growling stomachs. A good breakfast gives kids the best start to their day, providing vital nutrients for young minds and bodies.</p><p>Today, only about half of the kids who may need a healthy school breakfast are getting one. For example, something as simple as what time breakfast is served in high-need schools can mean the difference between nutrition and hunger for millions of kids. Making this meal a seamless part of the school day, serving it after the bell, would mean more kids could reliably get a healthy breakfast every morning and start the day ready to learn.</p><p>Our Kellogg Company Fund grants have helped provide 20 million new breakfasts since 2009; with No Kid Hungry, we have been able to increase participation in school breakfast programs, so kids get the fuel they need for their brains and bodies.</p><p>No one can do this work alone. Everyone can make a difference in the life of a hungry child. As you celebrate Father&rsquo;s Day with your own families this year, here are some ways you can help others:</p><p>How can you help?</p><p>If there is no breakfast program at your child&rsquo;s school, ask what they need to start one. Sometimes it&rsquo;s as simple as needing coolers for milk or larger trash containers for clean-up.</p><p>When you can, provide food to your local food bank. Breakfast foods, in particular, are important to local families. Not sure what to give? Bring the foods that your kids enjoy.</p><p>Are you a community volunteer?</p><p>Consider lending your time and talents to your local food bank, or</p><p>Stop by your local school to see if they need volunteers to help distribute breakfast in the classrooms</p><p>The important thing is that we can all contribute in some way to making sure that no child starts the day hungry. Solving this problem is within our reach, if we all reach out.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/grape_girl_rs_0.jpg",1,Partnerships | #TeamNoKidHungry

Thanks to their generosity, we&rsquo;ll be able to provide two million meals to kids, an incredible feat, especially for a company that's new to Dine Out for No Kid Hungry.</p><p>To celebrate, our friends at the Habit Burger Grill invited us to San Diego recently, where I was honored to shake hands with some of the employees who worked so hard to make this happen. I was so inspired by their passion and eagerness; it was obvious that they care very deeply about No Kid Hungry and the work that we&rsquo;re able to accomplish with their help. The Habit Burger's newest food truck was there too, with another amazing deal &mdash; for a small donation, guests received a charburger with cheese, fries and a drink &ndash; with all proceeds going to benefit our local partner, the <a href=""http://www.sandiegohungercoalition.org/"">San Diego Hunger Coalition</a>.</p><p>Feeding kids is a natural fit for the cooks, servers and managers who feed people every day at restaurants across America, and No Kid Hungry relies on them to raise funds and awareness for our work. The Habit Burger made it easy for us to partner with them because their enthusiasm is contagious. From CEO to server, their commitment to making giving back a habit is evident in everything they do.</p><p>We&rsquo;re grateful to Habit Burger&rsquo;s employees and customers. Together, we&rsquo;re one step closer to permanently ending childhood hunger in America.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/habitburger_0.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:398px; width:600px"" /></p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/habitburger_0.jpg",1,Habit Burger | no kid hungry

Increasing participation in school breakfast is a new concept for them but they have already seen great results in a very short amount of time. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always participated in National School Breakfast Week and encouraged kids to eat breakfast,&rdquo; Jennifer noted, &ldquo;But now we are focused on designing new strategies and looking at new models to get more participation in breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p><u>Golf Carts:</u> Jennifer&rsquo;s district received a grant to retrofit three existing golf carts with equipment to hold and serve hot and cold food, as well as a Point-of-Sale system that connects right to the school meal computer system. These golf carts exist to bring meals to the students, especially on the bigger, more sprawling campuses. Each cart can hold about 75-100 breakfasts at a time, and in this pilot phase the golf carts have helped to feed 120 additional breakfasts each day. Jennifer compares the carts to a food truck&ndash;breakfast cart hybrid. Kids who get to school at the last minute who otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have time to get to the cafeteria are able to still grab a meal on their way to class, meaning they won&rsquo;t miss out on breakfast.</p><p><u>&ldquo;Magical Breakfast&rdquo;:</u> Sponsored by Kellogg&rsquo;s, this campaign is allowing any student who eats breakfast to be entered in to winning a pair of tickets to Disney World. This year 9 pairs of tickets are up for grabs (one winner per week) and the increase in breakfast participation is up from last year by 4% district wide in elementary schools alone. &nbsp;</p><p><u>Changing Perceptions of Breakfast in the Classroom:</u> In some schools in Jennifer&rsquo;s district, breakfast in the classroom is now a breakfast concierge service.&nbsp; Food and Nutrition Services staff deliver food to the classroom in a &ldquo;room service&rdquo; style, as they always have, but this change in title gives the program an upscale feel.&nbsp; The district menu team and school managers also worked together to create a &ldquo;breakfast for achievers&rdquo; menu that&rsquo;s spill-proof, without syrups or sauces, to keep messes to a minimum.</p><p>Jennifer and her team credit their breakfast innovation to a district-wide commitment to increase breakfast participation. Having the support of the superintendent and the school board and a district policy that makes breakfast mandatory in every school has changed the whole culture of the district.</p><p><strong>Jennifer&rsquo;s Top Marketing Ideas for Promoting School Breakfast:</strong></p><ul>	<li>Create a menu of different breakfast delivery methods to give different schools the opportunity to choose what works for them.</li>	<li>Conduct focus groups and understand the wants and needs of your students. Look at the demographics and learn what the students like and don&rsquo;t like in different age groups or schools.</li>	<li>Meet students where they are. Don&rsquo;t expect students to find the breakfast program, take breakfast to them.&nbsp; This may mean delivering to the classroom, setting up grab and go kiosks to catch students entering school from the bus, or even putting breakfast on wheels to find students all throughout campus!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>	<li>Reach out to vendors and ask them what they&rsquo;re able to provide as a marketing incentive to get more kids eating or to improve the products being offered.</li></ul>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/jennifer_smith.jpg",1,no kid hungry | national school breakfast week | school breakfast | florida | Breakfast Heroes

She volunteers with the specific goal to empower people to build positive relationships with food based on the lessons taught in Cooking Matters.</p><p>Another volunteer has a very different background and reason for wanting to end childhood hunger. As a stay-at-home-mom with a degree in nutrition, she was shocked by the stories her children&rsquo;s friends shared about the meals they had at home and at school. They were frequently not receiving proper nutrition and had no idea how to cook for themselves. Recognizing that education was key to changing the food problems in her neighborhood, she joined Cooking Matters to bring nutrition and culinary tools to her community.</p><p>These are just two examples of individuals responding to an internal call to action by volunteering with Share our Strength&rsquo;s Cooking Matters. You don&rsquo;t have to have a fancy degree or a specific background to join Cooking Matters. You can volunteer for any number of reasons, and by bringing your unique experiences, you add value to each Cooking Matters course.</p><p>Why not volunteer today?</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/julie11.jpg",1,no kid hungry | cooking matters | volunteer | americorps

The photo reminds a very pessimistic side of me that there are issues that go beyond political party ideology, and hunger relief is one of those issues. I love the feeling that the work I&rsquo;m doing is, however small, making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives. It&rsquo;s the type of work that is removed from politics and calls on people&rsquo;s drive to do good. Working on the No Kid Hungry bake sale this July reassured me of that fact, and proved to me that ending childhood hunger is an issue that everyone can agree on.&nbsp;</p><p>My coworkers and I spread out across the central Arkansas region to find restaurants and bakeries that would be willing to donate food for the bake sale. The first stop was at a popular local caf&eacute;. We walked in and said that we were putting on a community bake sale to support the No Kid Hungry campaign. We briefly described the campaign, which amounted to saying, &ldquo;helps feed children throughout the country and in the state too&rdquo;. We received five dozen custom cookies; the whole process took four minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The first cafe wasn&rsquo;t an outlier: it was just the beginning of a near identical chain of events. I would walk into a bakery, tell them a little about what we were trying to do, and walk out with an order form for 2 dozen cupcakes or 15 baguettes. It was amazing to see all these different managers and owners guarantee food for us on the spot. I would ask if the restaurant would want a letterhead from our organization, the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, to help confirm that all the food was going to the bake sale. One of the owners I asked just looked at me and said, &ldquo;Nah, I like the cause and I can trust you.&rdquo; This bakery was a bit further away from the Alliance and had not worked with us for before, as many of the other volunteers had. However, because of the type of work the Alliance and No Kid Hungry work on together, the manager was still compelled to donate; he wanted to trust me, so he did.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s the reason I love the work that I do. People want to help anti-hunger efforts, and I can see genuine good happening. People want to make sure children are fed and will support efforts that allow that to happen, no matter their political affiliation. It&rsquo;s why we held a successful bake sale, and it&rsquo;s why I want to keep doing this type of work in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/nkh_bipartisan.jpg",1,No Kid Hungry Youth Ambassadors | arkansas | bake sale | Generation No Kid Hungry

My wife, Nancy, and I have three children, including an adopted daughter. When we brought her home she was one of these undernourished children. That&rsquo;s why I am so impassioned about the many important collaborations working to solve the issue of child hunger.</p><p>Take our company, for example. At Kellogg, we believe that every hungry child deserves to start the day with the power of breakfast. We&rsquo;re working with partners to make breakfasts available in schools around the world because we know that doing so is the very best way to get this important meal to hungry kids.</p><ul>	<li>In the U.S., we have helped our partners &ndash; including No Kid Hungry &ndash; increase participation in school breakfast programs. Our Kellogg Company Fund grants have helped provide 20 million new breakfasts since 2009.</li>	<li>Overseas, where few breakfast programs exist, we&rsquo;re establishing Breakfast Clubs where needy children can come have breakfast before the school day begins.</li></ul><p>I encourage you to read <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/blog/school-meals/2014/10/breakfast-classroom-teachers-perspective"">Cheryl Bost's excellent post</a> to this blog, providing a teacher&rsquo;s perspective on breakfast in the classroom. Not only do kids get the nutrition they need to start the day, but breakfast affords a unique time to build communities in our classrooms.</p><p>Also at Kellogg, we&rsquo;re donating food to needy families to make sure breakfast is available at home.</p><ul>	<li>Since 2013, we&rsquo;ve donated more than 1.4 billion servings of food to food banks and other charitable programs as part of our global Breakfast for Better Days&trade; initiative.</li>	<li>We&rsquo;ve also helped create a food banking infrastructure where none existed in a number of countries.</li></ul><p>As we&rsquo;ve learned more, expanded our partnerships and strengthened our commitment to making sure every hungry child starts the day with breakfast, we&rsquo;ve also seen that no one can do this work alone, and everyone can make a difference in the life of a hungry child.</p><p>Because ending child hunger is an issue so many of our consumers also care passionately about, we&rsquo;ve giving them a chance to make a difference as well. For every specially marked Give a Child Breakfast package of Kellogg&rsquo;s cereal purchased in 2016, we&rsquo;ll donate 1 percent of sales&nbsp;to No Kid Hungry for the expansion of school breakfast programs.

Today, instead of having to wait in line to eat their breakfast in the cafeteria before the start of school, students report directly to the classroom where their breakfasts are waiting for them. So far, Hutchison Elementary&rsquo;s Breakfast in the Classroom program has been a huge success!</p><p>Before starting Breakfast in the Classroom, only about 300 of the school&rsquo;s 1,000 students were eating breakfast at school. Thanks to Breakfast in the Classroom, nearly <em>every</em> student is now participating in school breakfast, leading to more nutritiously-fed brains and bellies ready for full days of learning!</p><p>Katie Ferguson, a teacher at Hutchison Elementary, understands the struggle many of her students face when it comes to food. She sees it in her classroom every day. Ms. Ferguson used to worry about one student, in particular. &ldquo;I know she doesn&rsquo;t always get dinner and when breakfast was served in the cafeteria, I saw that she wouldn&rsquo;t always eat breakfast.&rdquo; Thanks to Breakfast in the Classroom, Ms. Ferguson knows that this child is receiving at <em>least</em> two nutritious meals each school day. Since moving to Breakfast in the Classroom, Ms. Ferguson and the rest of Hutchison Elementary&rsquo;s staff are able to focus on teaching and enriching students&rsquo; lives, instead of worrying about their students being hungry and not having the energy to focus and learn during the day.</p><p>At first, the Breakfast in the Classroom program raised some eyebrows because of the potential for mess in the classroom; however, the teachers at Hutchison Elementary decided that the occasional spilled milk was a small price to pay for their students having the fuel they need to learn. Thanks to Fairfax County&rsquo;s Food Service Department, the transition from traditional breakfast service to Breakfast in the Classroom was smoother than anyone could have expected. Spilled milk is rare, students are fed, and everyone can focus on making each school day count.</p><p>There is no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that Breakfast in the Classroom is a good thing for the students and staff at Hutchison Elementary. Every meal enriches students&rsquo; lives, making their futures a little brighter each and every day.</p><p>Kudos to Principal Lonnett, the staff and students at Hutchison Elementary, as well as Fairfax County&rsquo;s Food Service Department for making Breakfast the in the Classroom such a success!</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/rsz_20140514-new-york-0070.jpg",1,no kid hungry | Youth Ambassador | virginia | school breakfast

Tucked in a valley in the Appalachian Mountains, reaching this small town in eastern Tennessee from any direction requires negotiating a series of hair pin turns up and down mountains. There&rsquo;s no interstate nearby, the closest major town is about an hour away. Only about 6,000 people call this isolated community home.</p><p>I was in Sneedville because No Kid Hungry was conducting a summer meals pilot to test the best way to operate a &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; style delivery model. We worked with our campaign partner in Tennessee, and a local church group to arrange a delivery system that drops off summer meals for kids either at their homes, or at drop-off points where families can pick-up the food and take it home. Shaina, an Americorps member and native of Sneedville was my guide. She patiently allowed me to tag along with a videographer, interviewing families as she dropped off food for their kids. Shaina&rsquo;s four-hour route takes her all over this valley &shy;&shy;-- up mountains, down dirt roads that are nearly impassable during heavy rains, and across some of the most beautiful, pristine country side you&rsquo;ll ever see.</p><p>It was lucky I was with Shaina. Many families refused to let us film the food delivery, I can only speculate that they were both distrustful of outsiders and didn&rsquo;t want to bring attention to themselves. There are still people in this community that don&rsquo;t have indoor plumbing. Others lived in homes so dilapidated that front doors don&rsquo;t shut properly, windows were missing glass, a well-placed boulder acts as a step up to the door instead of a deck or stairs. Many of these homes were surrounded by pieces of the family&rsquo;s past, broken down cars and televisions, rusting farm equipment. Most of the area isn&rsquo;t serviced by a trash pick-up, people have to bring their refuse to the local dump. It takes a car to get your trash to the dump, and money to buy gas for that car, so many people opt to let their trash build up outside in piles or in metal cans until there&rsquo;s enough to burn.</p><p>Five days a week, Shaina loads up her SUV with a breakfast and a lunch for every child on her route. Faith and Natalia are one of her first stops. Faith is in her mid-twenties, but her life has already been destroyed by drugs. It was fitting that my last day in Sneedville was the same day <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/senate-opioid-addiction-bill.html"">Congress passed legislation</a> to combat the opioid crisis in this country. Every single one of the families I met had been affected by the destructive forces of addiction. Faith&rsquo;s first two kids were taken away by the state. Her daughter Natalia is just about a year old. Faith is pregnant again. She&rsquo;s clean now, and living with two other women in a tiny, one-bedroom house at the end of a long dirt road. It&rsquo;s tidy and orderly inside, but blankets cover the ripped plastic in the windows where the glass should be, you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what will happen to them when it gets cold. Natalia is starting to eat solid foods and the apple sauce and cereals that come in the meal delivery help Faith save a bit her SNAP dollars. The women that live in the house all pool their food together to make it last a bit longer.</p><p>Sue never expected to be a mom for a second time. When her daughter&rsquo;s life crumbled under the weight of addiction, it forever changed Sue&rsquo;s life too. Her one-bedroom trailer isn&rsquo;t meant for three people, but Sue and her two grandchildren make do. Patrick and Scarlett share a bed in the bedroom, Sue sleeps on a recliner. They live about 5 miles from the town&rsquo;s only grocery store and don&rsquo;t have a car. They&rsquo;ve never been to a summer meals site because the kids have no way of getting there. People drive fast on the country roads, and Sue worries about people high on drugs hitting the kids if they walked or took bikes, but that&rsquo;s a moot point since they don&rsquo;t have bikes anyway. Sue skips meals sometimes to make sure the kids eat, when I ask her about it she just brushes it off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old, I don&rsquo;t need much to eat anyhow.&rdquo; Sue is always laughing, Scarlett and Patrick inherited that from her. And, they&rsquo;re both honor roll students, clearly whip smart. Scarlett pulls me down to her level and then tells me that if I want to call her Charlotte I can, and then nearly falls over laughing at her own joke.</p><p>Chloe is delighted when we get to her house. She&rsquo;s only five, but she loves people. We saw a snakeskin she found in the woods, we were introduced to all her dogs and cats. She insisted that I take her picture from <em>many</em> different angles. Louise is another grandmother that found herself entering a second round of motherhood. Her son struggles with addiction, he left Chloe and her baby brother Noah to be raised by Louise and her husband. Their cabin is nestled in a quiet meadow. It emerges like a bastion of comfortable, intentional solitude when you come upon it after a drive through the woods and up and down several steep mountain sides. Louise laughs when I ask if she&rsquo;d bring Chloe to a summer meals site in the future, they only drive when it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. Gas costs money.</p><p>The program we&rsquo;re piloting in Sneedville is doing exactly what it set out to do, it&rsquo;s reaching kids in hard to reach places. This pilot has fed just a few of the children that rank among the millions missing out on summer meals programs because of the inefficiencies of the current program. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist next year, those kids will continue to miss out. Transportation barriers are too immense to get them to summer meals programs.</p><p>The heartbreaking truth is that there are little kids just like Scarlett, Chloe and Patrick all over this nation, and they&rsquo;re waiting for help. The way the current summer meals program is structured, however, we simply can&rsquo;t reach them. That&rsquo;s not good enough. It&rsquo;s critical that we urge Congress to stand up for these kids. We need policies that let programs like the one in Sneedville become more than a pilot. We need policies encourage innovation. And we need policies that get the job done, but until Congress passes new summer meals legislation, help is not on the way for the millions of kids who struggle with summer hunger.

Today, I have close to 200 staff serving more than 100,000 meals at all of our locations nationwide.</p><p><strong>How did you become involved with No Kid Hungry?</strong><br />While meeting with a supplier, Local Roots, I commented on a bicycle set up on a trainer in their conference room. The founders of the company, Dan Kuenzi and Eric Ellestad told me they were training for a three-day, 300-mile ride and suggested I join them. My initial thoughts were: &ldquo;three days off work riding a bicycle? For charity, so I don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty? I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo; I emailed you the next day and started fundraising. The 2016 ride remains among the most fun and coolest things I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p><p><strong>We love to hear that! What was a favorite moment?</strong><br />The evening of day two on the ride, when we were all together in the parking lot of the hotel as the donations topped $1 million ... that was pretty awesome. Also, crossing the finish line as a group in the Team Time Trial at the Blackberry Farm Pro-Am Classic with my Chefs Cycle teammates was a really special moment.</p><p><strong>Why is this mission - ending childhood hunger - important to you?</strong><br />As a father of five children, I am strongly affected by the thought that other kids might not have enough to eat. I feel it&rsquo;s critically important to protect all kids, everywhere, and future health and development through proper nutrition.</p><p><strong>What's been one of the most rewarding parts of that work for you?</strong><br />First, the tangible results of our efforts in ending childhood hunger &ndash; the millions of meals provided. Also, I can&rsquo;t downplay the importance of the new friends I&rsquo;ve made through Chefs Cycle and the camaraderie and the esprit d&rsquo; corps we&rsquo;ve developed.</p><p><strong>Chefs Cycle is just a few months away. Are you training?</strong><br />I have a full schedule with work and family so I fit it in where I can! I cross train every morning, Mon &ndash; Fri at 4:30 am (running, CrossFit) and try to ride at least two afternoons a week. I do long training rides on Saturdays and Sundays. As the days get longer and it&rsquo;s light earlier in the morning, I&rsquo;ll start adding some early morning weekday rides, too.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite post-ride meal?</strong><br />Post training, I love simple whole foods. Raw cashews, avocado, grapefruit, banana and sprouted raisin bread are among my favorites.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/ted_cizma_0.jpg",1,no kid hungry | Chefs Cycle | Ted Cizma | SpaceX

We held our annual No Kid Hungry Bake Sale this past weekend at the Argenta Farmers&rsquo; Market in North Little Rock, and met with huge success! Local bakeries as well as individuals donate their specialties then we sell them at a farmer&rsquo;s market booth to raise awareness about No Kid Hungry nationally and right here in Arkansas.</p><p>Arkansas ranks among the highest in the nation in food insecurity among children. 26.3% of children in the state are food insecure, meaning they don&rsquo;t know where they will get their next meal. In the summer, food insecurity for children becomes even worse, as they cannot rely on school breakfast and lunch. The No Kid Hungry program is working to solve the problem of summer hunger by organizing both permanent and mobile summer meal sites. By working at the Alliance this summer, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to see these meal sites firsthand. Seeing No Kid Hungry&rsquo;s immediate, positive effects on the children of Little Rock has been an absolute privilege.</p><p>Our bake sale raised a total of $538.30 (plus in the month of July Domino Sugar matched the amount raised, totaling over $1K!), which was so much more than I anticipated. It was really incredible to see local bakeries so eager to help our cause &ndash; they were very generous with their donations. It was both fun and rewarding to see our efforts in planning the bake sale pay off right in front of our eyes; customers at our booth were almost always willing to donate money in addition to buying something from us. And at the end of the day, we took anything remaining to Our House, a local homeless shelter for families. Their excitement and gratitude was worth so much more than the $538 we raised.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/us_and_kathy.jpg",1,No Kid Hungry Youth Ambassadors | Bridget Casey | arkansas | bake sale for no kid hungry

We&rsquo;ve crossed a threshold where more than half of all public school students now live in low-income families. One in 5 children in our nation lives in a family that struggles with hunger.&nbsp;</p><p>These are complicated issues, but childhood hunger is a solvable problem. We have the ability to ensure all kids get the healthy food they need, every day. And the Social Innovation Fund is a critical component in reaching that goal.</p><p>We have enough food in this nation, and the food programs we need to end childhood hunger are already in place. The problem: A lack of coordination, innovation, and sustainability has meant participation rates in some of these programs are alarmingly low. Simply put, these programs don&rsquo;t always reach the kids who need them.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s solvable, but we can&rsquo;t do it alone. Since 2010, No Kid Hungry has been building the public-private partnerships needed for lasting, transformational change in the fight to end childhood hunger. Teaming up with the Social Innovation Fund in 2014 provided the catalyst to scale this work to the next level.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalservice.gov%2Fsif&amp;t=M2Y0NjlkYTkzZTQ2NjE0OWRmYjBiZDA5MjM4NjRkODRiYzNhNTg2Yyw4WEtpaUNvcw%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">Social Innovation Fund</a>&nbsp;is a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that engages millions of Americans in service. In just six years, the Social Innovation Fund and its private-sector partners have invested more than half a billion dollars in compelling community solutions. As a result of $295 million in federal grants and more than $583 million in non-federal match commitments, the Social Innovation Fund has awarded 43 grants to grantmaking institutions supporting over 350 nonprofits working in 40 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>With the Social Innovation Fund, we created and strengthened public-private partnerships that allowed us to leverage the strengths of the nonprofit, corporate, and government sectors to invest in what we know works and bring it to scale. These new, dynamic partnerships have become local laboratories, putting bold ideas to the test and finding proven, practical solutions. And the rigorous evaluation process allows us to ensure these bold new plans have measurable, effective results.</p><p>Today we are working with six of the highest performing organizations ending hunger around the nation. We are also working with corporations like Arby&rsquo;s and General Mills to bring the power of the private sector into these solutions.</p><p>This strategy is working.</p><p>In Florida, our partner, Florida Impact, is building an action plan to partner with one of the biggest school districts in the country to change the way it serves breakfast so all kids in need can get a healthy morning meal. In Washington, United Way of King County partnered with the Seattle Sounders, an American soccer team, to launch a School Breakfast Challenge, creating incentives for schools to increase participation to make sure kids are fed and breakfast is a positive start to the school day. In Clark County, Nevada, Three Square Food Bank is partnering with food service officials and principals to increase participation in child nutrition programs and ensure successful implementation of the school breakfast legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Surrounding kids with healthy meals is achievable in every corner of this country &ndash; from urban Seattle, to suburban parts of Michigan, to deep in the Heart of Texas.&nbsp;Together, we are harnessing the power of public and private resources to scale solutions that will end hunger for 16 million kids in America.</p>",,"src=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/sites/default/files/billysif.jpg",1,no kid hungry | Social Innovation Fund | SIF | billy shore

It's not a problem that makes the news very often, but it poses a terrible threat to the lives and futures of 13 million kids in America.</p><p>It's a complex problem. To feed all those children you need food, funding, trained staff and equipment. But there is something that solves all of those problems, and its right in front of us.</p><p>It's school breakfast.</p><p>Almost every child facing hunger attends a public school, where they get a healthy lunch, for free or at a reduced price, every day. The system, the staff and the infrastructure to feed daily meals to kids is already in place, in our neighborhood schools. Most importantly, federal funding already exists to pay for not just lunches at school, but breakfast too.</p><p><strong>So why aren't kids eating a free breakfast at school? </strong>A few reasons.</p><p>-- It's hard for any parent to get their kid to school early, when breakfast is served, and low-income families are even less likely to have extra time and resources at their disposal.</p><p>-- It can also be embarrassing to feel singled out, and kids are especially sensitive to that pressure.</p><p>So what do we do?<strong> It's simple</strong>. Instead of serving breakfast in the cafeteria before the bell, we make it part of the regular day, served in the classroom after school starts. Every kid is already there, and if everyone gets whole grain cereal, fresh fruit and orange juice, then no one feels singled out.</p><p>Most importantly, breakfast has real, powerful effects for kids. <a href=""http://hungerinourschools.org/img/NKH-HungerInOurSchoolsReport-2015.pdf"">Research shows</a> that students who eat breakfast score significantly higher on tests, and miss less days of school. Those improvements mean those kids are more likely to graduate.</p><p>This isn't just an idea. <strong>It's really working.</strong></p><p>As we celebrate <a href=""http://schoolnutrition.org/Meetings/Events/NSBW/2017/"">National School Breakfast Week</a>, we're proud to say that more than 3 million more kids are eating breakfast at school since No Kid Hungry started. Thanks to the commitment of teachers, parents and community leaders, along with our local partners across the country and other great national organizations, we have seen real change for kids.</p><p>Breakfast, such a small thing, turns out to be a big solution.</p><p><em>Does your child&rsquo;s school serve breakfast as part of the school day? If not, get involved.

His groundbreaking Upton 43 was named Best Restaurant of the Year 2016 by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and Eater recently named it one of the 21 best new restaurants in America. Erick has been an incredibly generous friend to Share Our Strength Minneapolis and the No Kid Hungry campaign over the years. Whether representing Victory 44 or Upton 43, he has brought impeccable, creative, vegetable-forward dishes to Hotlist and Taste of the Nation, and when La Belle Vie closed shortly before a Taste of the Nation event, Erick jumped in to cover their table and make sure the guests seated there had a wonderful experience.</p><p>We love hearing about Erick's kids and how they've inspired him, and we take great inspiration from culinary creativity and his generosity.</p><p><strong>How did you become involved with No Kid Hungry?</strong><br />Man, it&rsquo;s been a long time -- I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was Chef Seth Bixby-Daugherty of Minneapolis that first asked me to get involved.</p><p><strong>Why is ending childhood hunger important to you?</strong><br />I am a father of four young boys, ages 7, 8, 10, 11. They eat - they eat well and they eat a lot. It seems impossible for me even to fathom a child not being able to eat. In a country with so many resources it&rsquo;s unacceptable for any child to go hungry or not get proper nutrition. The food we eat forms the basis of our health. Kids who have access to the food they need are better supported both emotionally and academically in school. Regular meals like school breakfast and school lunch provides kids with sustained energy to thrive in sports and other physical activities. And, with a mind toward service, for those of us blessed with prosperity or financial stability, there is simply no reason not to get involved and put an end to this problem!</p><p><strong>If you were giving advice to a fellow chef looking to get involved in ending hunger, what would you tell them to do? </strong></p><ul>	<li>Use your social media platforms and your strong reputation to bring awareness to the issue of childhood hunger in the US.</li>	<li>We are able to donate our time and culinary resources to large events &ndash; like Taste of the Nation &ndash; that raise lots of money and awareness. It&rsquo;s a simple way to give back.</li>	<li>We work with food for a living and can be highly effective in helping to end childhood hunger. Get involved with your local school district, be involved in your community.</li></ul><p><strong>It&rsquo;s hot! What&rsquo;s are your favorite meals to stay cool in the summer?</strong><br />I absolutely love summer salads: tomato salads, melon salads, corn salads. Keep it fresh and simple.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s growing season! What veggies are you cooking?</strong><br />Ramps, green garlic, nettles, radishes&hellip; a bounty of delicious product is available now. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find time to play with everything!</p><p><strong>Why did you become a chef? How long have you been cooking?</strong><br />I have always loved food and farming and wildlife. I think it was a really natural gravitation for me to become a chef. My grandpa Willard was a chef with a strong influence in Swedish cuisine and I am not sure if I really ever thought of doing anything else. I have been cooking professionally for 16 years.</p><p><strong>Which chefs have been influential in your career?</strong><br />I have had so many chefs influence me. On a world-class level, Ferran Adria, Marco Pierre White, Niklas Ekstedt, and Magnus Nilsson. I have also been influenced by stellar local chefs, including Alex Roberts, Steven Brown, and Gavin Kaysen.</p><p><strong>What is your most memorable experience in the kitchen?</strong><br />Having the opportunity to cook a special meal for Magnus Nilsson in an intimate setting and then eating quickly so we could get out bass fishing together&hellip; Somehow I always involve fishing or hunting into my great experiences!</p><p><strong>What do you cook or where do you eat on your day off?</strong><br />This time of year I mainly cook at home with my wife and kids. I love to cook over open fire. Slow-cooked meats, charred vegetables, simple presentations.</p><p><strong>Would you be interested in sharing a favorite recipe with us?</strong><br />Of course! Here&rsquo;s my recipe for Kroppkaka, salt pork with pickled carrots and Vasterbotten cheese.</p><p><strong>Kroppkaka</strong><br /><em>Salt Pork, Pickled Carrots, Vasterbotten Cheese</em></p><p><em>Filling Ingredients</em></p><ul>	<li>1 lb salt pork or bacon, cut into small dice</li>	<li>2 ea large onions, cut into small dice</li>	<li>1 T chopped fresh thyme</li></ul><p><em>Filling Method</em><br />Fry the bacon in a large pan until it&rsquo;s about 75% done. Add the onions and continue to fry until everything is crispy and golden brown. Sprinkle in the thyme, give a stir, and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p><p><em>Dough Ingredients </em></p><ul>	<li>3 &frac12; lbs potatoes, peeled, boiled, then put through a ricer and allowed to cool</li>	<li>1 egg, beaten</li>	<li>&frac12; -1 c all-purpose flour</li>	<li>pinch salt</li>	<li>pinch white pepper</li>	<li>pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li></ul><p><em>Dough Method</em><br />Fold beaten egg into riced, cooled potato. Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg. Slowly add flour, stirring gently. Continue to add flour until a dough forms and no longer feels sticky.</p><p><em>To Assemble</em><br />Take a small ball of dough and flatten in the palm of your hand. Add 1 tablespoon of the bacon-onion mixture, folding dough around filling to completely enclose. Set aside and continue with remaining potato and filling.</p><p><em>Pickled Carrots </em></p><ul>	<li>2 large carrots, thinly sliced into coins</li>	<li>1 clove garlic, peeled and thinly sliced</li>	<li>1 T yellow mustard seed</li>	<li>1 c cider vinegar</li>	<li>&frac12; c honey</li>	<li>&frac12; c water</li>	<li>1 T kosher salt</li></ul><p><em>Pickled Carrots Ingredients</em><br />Place carrots in a bowl large enough to hold all ingredients. Season carrots with the kosher salt to release a little of the natural carrot liquid. Add remaining ingredients to a pot and bring to boil over high heat. Remove from heat and let cool until just warm to touch. Pour warm liquid over carrots and let sit for 2 hours at room temperature or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</p><p><em>Vasterbotten Cheese Sauce Ingredients</em></p><ul>	<li>2 c whole milk</li>	<li>4 oz grated Vasterbotten cheese (or substitute your favorite hard cheese, like cheddar)</li>	<li>2 T butter</li>	<li>1 T all-purpose flour</li>	<li>pinch salt</li>	<li>pinch white pepper</li>	<li>pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li></ul><p><em>Vasterbotten Cheese Sauce Method</em><br />Melt butter in large pan over medium heat until browned. Add flour and stir together to create a roux, cooking for a few minutes. Slowly add milk, continuing to stir, cooking until the mixture starts to thicken. Add cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, stirring until combined. Set aside.</p><p><em>To Finish</em><br />Prepare a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Drop the prepared Kroppkaka into boiling water and cook until they float. Remove with a slotted spoon and move to your serving dish, spooning cheese sauce over the top and garnishing with pickled carrot slices and your favorite fresh herbs (my favorites for this dish are fresh dill or chives).</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/chef_erick_harcey_0.png",1,no kid hungry | chef | Kroppkaka | Erick Harcey

School breakfast is a critical way to ensure kids get the consistent nutrition they need to feel better, learn more and grow up strong.</p><p>Here are <strong>five things you should know </strong>about the role of school breakfast in the lives of hungry children.</p><p><strong>Breakfast is an education issue</strong><br />Just like textbooks and pencils, teachers see food and nutrition as a basic school supply that's instrumental to a student's success. According to our recent <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/pdfs/HIOS_2017.pdf"">Hunger in Our Schools</a> report, 3 out of 4 educators see students who regularly come to school hungry because they&rsquo;re not getting enough to eat at home.</p><p>And they recognize the toll it takes. When students don&rsquo;t get enough to eat, 80% of teachers see them lose the ability to concentrate and 76% see poor academic performance. This impacts kids&rsquo; ability to succeed. Access to school meals like breakfast not only reduces growling tummies, but increases test scores and graduation rates.</p><p><strong>Skipping breakfast has a negative effect on health and behavior</strong><br />When students miss a healthy morning meal they go to class hungry and are more likely to experience health issues. 62% of teachers see behavior and discipline problems when kids come to class hungry, and 47% see sicker and less healthy students. Studies show that children from low-income families who eat school breakfast miss less school days.</p><p><strong>Only a fraction of kids who qualify for school breakfast are eating it</strong><br />59% of children from low-income families say they&rsquo;ve come to school hungry. While free and reduced-price school meals work to close the gap between kids who have enough to eat and those that don&rsquo;t, the traditional way of serving breakfast before the school day starts is ineffective. Bus and carpool schedules make getting to school extra early a challenge for many kids from working families. As a result, only a fraction of the students who may need breakfast are unable to access it. Making breakfast part of the regular school day solves that problem.</p><p><strong>Stigma prevents kids from accessing the food they need</strong><br />When schools serve breakfast in the cafeteria before class, kids will go hungry to avoid the feeling of being labeled. When everyone eats together, it creates a feeling of community in the classroom, and kids who need that morning meal no longer feel singled out as the &ldquo;poor kids.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>There are more effective and efficient ways to serve breakfast</strong><br />School breakfast is critical for kids from low-income families. But, the traditional method of serving the meal before the school day starts is ineffective. Moving school breakfast out of the cafeteria and making it a part of the school day ensure that more low-income students are able to start the day with a healthy meal and a full stomach.</p><p>For more information about the scope of the problem, and role&nbsp;that school meals play in solving it, see our latest <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/pdfs/HIOS_2017.pdf"">Hunger in Our Schools</a> report.</p><p><em><strong>Need an infographic?</strong> <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/0i8lj7r6g8t3ez0/HIOS_infographic02.jpg?dl=0"">Click here to download one you can use or share</a>.</em></p>",/pdfs/HIOS_2017.pdf,"src=""/sites/default/files/20140211-nkh-bcps-2076_blog_rsz.jpg",1,NULL

But it&rsquo;s real.</p><p>All across the country, schools and community groups run summer meals sites where kids can eat breakfast and lunch - absolutely free. The programs are intended to fill the gap for children who benefit from school breakfast and lunch programs during the rest of the year.</p><p>The federal government estimates that <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/blog/summer-meals/2017/06/three-things-know-about-summer-meals"">4 million children in the United States face hunger during the summer months</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;These free meals programs are a critical way to ensure kids have access to healthy meals during the summer months,&rdquo; said Derrick Lambert, a program manager with No Kid Hungry. &ldquo;But we found that not enough families knew about them.&rdquo;</p><p>To solve this problem, the summer meals texting service was born. No Kid Hungry, <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/"">a national organization that works to end childhood hunger</a>, worked with the USDA to develop the program and runs it each summer. The service is free, and open to anyone. A parent, grandparent or caregiver can simply text the word &ldquo;FOOD&rdquo; to 877-877 and the system prompts the user to provide their address or zip code, which is used to provide the location and service times of up to three nearby summer meals sites.</p><p>The service is also available in Spanish, by texting the word &ldquo;COMIDA&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;FOOD&rdquo;.</p><p>The attention and disbelief has actually helped the program. Once enough people started posting about it on Facebook and other social media channels, <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/can-text-food-get-free-meals-children/"">the popular fact-checking website Snopes wrote about it</a>, rating the claim &ldquo;true&rdquo;. Thanks in part to this attention, the program has grown significantly, reaching a lot more kids in need. Last year there were 55,000 texts, but this year the service has already received 350,000 texts.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/summer_texting_v2_0.jpg",1,no kid hungry | summer meals | texting | Snopes

We all know that &ldquo;yes&rdquo; can be a powerful word especially when it comes to change.</p><p>Matt paints a vivid picture of how school breakfast operated &ndash; and affected students &ndash; before and after implementation of breakfast in the classroom. Previously in his school of 500 students, only 200 were eating school breakfast in the morning. Kids would arrive 25 minutes early, be ordered to stand in line quietly, ushered through to get their meal, and asked to sit down. Often, students did not have time to consume their meal before the bell rang and they rushed to the classroom. As Matt recalls, &ldquo;kids were constantly being fussed at by adults to settle down, stand in line and hurry up. It was not a great start to their day.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A new morning routine. </strong></p><p>Today, the cafeteria delivers insulated bags filled with breakfast to each classroom before the start of the day. Students look forward to being welcomed into the classroom by teachers and friends with a nutritious breakfast ready at their desk. They eat as a family in a calm setting that sets the tone for the remainder of the day. Matt can&rsquo;t think of a better way to build a caring community than to start the morning with breakfast together.</p><p class=""rtecenter""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/20140317-jeffbridges-1642.jpg"" style=""height:267px; width:400px"" /></p><p><strong>Breakfast changed the entire day.</strong></p><p>Matt is an enthusiastic proponent of breakfast in the classroom citing fewer discipline issues, nurse visits and tardiness. He debunks some common myths to help others get started:</p><ul>        <li><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t it take away instructional time? </strong>Before breakfast in the classroom, teachers used to spend more time dealing with discipline issues. Take those issues away and breakfast in the classroom actually adds to students&rsquo; productive time. Teachers use breakfast time for journal writing, calendar math or other activities to jumpstart the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>        <li><strong>Won&rsquo;t this be more work for teachers?</strong> At Daisy Bates, students apply and are selected to earn the job of classroom chef.&nbsp; These chefs are responsible for opening the bags and delivering the food so that breakfast is ready and available when the entire class arrives.</li>        <li><strong>What about the mess?</strong> Each classroom is provided wipes. After breakfast, the students wipe their desks down and take care of their own area. Before breakfast in the classroom, those desks didn&rsquo;t get cleaned very often. Now, Matt says they have the cleanest desks in the world!&nbsp;</li>        <li><strong>Isn&rsquo;t it expensive?</strong> No. Any additional increase in cost was offset by doubling the number of breakfast served with the additional federal reimbursement. They also received a small grant to purchase the breakfast bags.</li></ul>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/mattmellor.jpg | /sites/default/files/20140317-jeffbridges-1642.jpg",2,no kid hungry | national school breakfast week | school breakfast | arkansas | Breakfast Heroes

Fortunately, her school is implementing breakfast in the classroom, which means that more children are getting the fuel they need to start the day off right.</p><p><strong>Why do kids in your school need breakfast? Do you see the difference this is making for them? </strong>Absolutely I do. One year, I had a boy in my class who would always arrive late to school. If he was late, he missed breakfast in the cafeteria, and if he missed breakfast he would act out. His behavior was so bad that my other students would notice that he was calmer if he ate breakfast, so they began to save him juice or yogurt. They knew that if he had something to eat he would be much more focused. Breakfast in the classroom has made a huge difference for kids like him.</p><p><strong>What has been the biggest challenge with this effort?</strong> At first, some of the teachers, myself included, were resistant to making these changes. We had to go in a little earlier. We had to work together to get food for all the kids and to make sure that everything was efficiently cleaned up. We&rsquo;re in a routine now. Our custodial staff is awesome and the administration bought us all special food waste garbage bins to make clean up much easier on them and on us. The food is all very kid friendly and the mess is minimal which really helps to move the morning along.</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for other teachers who are apprehensive about serving a meal in the classroom? </strong>There will be hiccups, there will be spills, but if you find an organized way to work things will be much easier. Make a system and have a process to reduce any stress. Have paper towels ready to go, clear off tables before the food is put out. We have &ldquo;room inspectors&rdquo; which is another classroom job just like line leaders or door holders. They&rsquo;re in charge of wiping down tables and putting items into recycling or trash when the meal is over.</p><p class=""rtecenter""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/riverdale_elem-6-12-15_15_of_32.jpg"" /></p><p><strong>How do you balance incorporating instructional time while the kids are eating breakfast? </strong>At our school, the morning announcements are made on the TV at 8:15 AM. All staff in the building are required to have them on, and all the students are required to watch. The students can hear the announcements while they&rsquo;re eating. At the end of the announcements there are learning segments, such as showing a math problem, then pausing to give the kids time to figure out the answer, and then the announcers will demonstrate how to get the answer over the air. Sometimes they put up a &ldquo;sight word&rdquo; and practice saying and spelling it out loud along with the announcers. By the time the announcements are over the kids are finishing up eating and they&rsquo;ve also gotten in some brain-friendly movement and engagement at the same time.</p><p><strong>What do you consider to be the greatest achievement with serving breakfast? </strong>Our kids only get 15 minutes of recess each day. This extra time in the morning really allows them to focus on the day ahead and gives them more time to get to know one another. In my classroom, there are many students who have limited proficiency in English. Everyone comes from different cultures. The breakfast time in the mornings feels like a real family time, where everyone has a great sense of community. The kids are learning about one another and have a chance to really prepare for the day ahead together. Serving breakfast, in my opinion, is just so worth it. The kids need it, their developing brains need it, and I truly see the difference it is making in my school.</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/nice_picutre_of_mary_elise.jpg | /sites/default/files/riverdale_elem-6-12-15_15_of_32.jpg",2,no kid hungry | national school breakfast week | school breakfast | maryland | Breakfast Heroes

As a mother of four, she understands the importance of breakfast on a very personal level. That&rsquo;s why when No Kid Hungry Arkansas representative, Vivian Nicholson, visited her to talk about changing her breakfast model, it did not take long for Regena to get on board.</p><p>Regena recounts the journey of her district and the key elements of their success:</p><ul>        <li><strong>Get your principals on board first:</strong> Many of her principals attended a conference where they learned about the link between breakfast and academic performance. They came back excited and Regena took full advantage of their energy. Principals then worked with teachers and gained buy-in within their buildings.</li>        <li><strong>Engage partners</strong>: Pulaski engaged a range of partners to help them kick off the transition successfully. Between the No Kid Hungry technical assistance, Fuel Up to Play 60 branded cooler bags, and grants from the Arkansas Meals for Achievement initiative, the community came out in full support. Even the governor visited to see breakfast in the classroom making a difference.</li>        <li><strong>Smart scheduling matters</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, breakfast in the classroom does not mean an increase in staff time. Regena was able to restructure her staff time to ensure prep work was done the day before. She balanced high and low-prep items together to even out each day. She admits it was trial and error, but did not take long to figure out what worked for her schools and what didn&rsquo;t.</li>        <li><strong>Put your customers first</strong>: Regena is a firm believer in talking with students and understanding their food preferences. She hosts taste testing events and conducts feedback surveys from students as a regular business practice. As a result, she now serves more breakfasts than lunches at two of her schools!</li>        <li><strong>Address hurdles early</strong>: Regena approaches any barrier with a can-do attitude. She listens to issues from principals, teachers, parents and students and addresses them head-on. Pre-packaged peaches were impossible for little hands to open, so they changed the fruit offering. She appeased custodial concerns by changing to using real trays at lunch, dramatically reducing their overall trash. She also regularly communicates with parents via Facebook to ensure their voices are being heard.</li>        <li><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Breakfast in the classroom does not cost more. Yes, the district will see an increase in food costs because you are serving more kids food! This cost is offset by the increase in breakfast participation and additional reimbursement.</li></ul><p class=""rtecenter""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/prn_3200-2918663588-o.jpg"" style=""height:267px; width:400px"" /></p><p>Breakfast after the bell is just the beginning in Pulaski.

I believe hunger is not due to a lack of resources, but rather it is an injustice rooted in the systemic inequalities of our country. Raising awareness about hunger and community based solutions, such as summer meals programs, is vital for providing healthy, nutritious food to every individual regardless of who they are or where they live.</strong></p><p>What&rsquo;s one thing you have learned this Summer?</p><p><strong>One thing I have learned is that the fight against hunger is a team effort. The most important work my co-intern and I have done this summer has been connected to the work of local community partners. I have realized that nothing grows from the top down. Hunger can only be eradicated when you enable communities to partner with nonprofit organizations like End Hunger CT! and share tools and resources to effect change.</strong></p><p>What would you say to someone your age looking to get involved?</p><p><strong>I would tell someone my age to focus on their own community. Many times youth who are looking to volunteer forget about the people who might be hungry or in-need of support right in their own neighborhood. It is important to realize that hunger exists everywhere and that we need creative teen and young adult partners to help conceive the most effective ways to make sure their communities are getting the resources they need.</strong></p><p>If you could tell the world one thing about hunger, what would you say?</p><p><strong>I would say that in a world full of plenty, close to 50 million Americans, including 13 million children, still struggle to get enough nutritious food on a regular basis. Nearly 50 million Americans still need our help to make sure they never have to go another day hungry.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,"src=""/sites/default/files/large_0107_share_our_strength_mike_shauck.jpg | /sites/default/files/mikayla_gif",2,Generation NKH; Amherst College; No Kid Hungry Youth Ambassador; Summer Meals; Spotlight; Hunger Advocate; Youth
