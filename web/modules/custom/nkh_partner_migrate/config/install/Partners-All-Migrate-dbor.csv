For every Wanderlust 108 ticket purchased, Wanderlust will donate $1.08 to No Kid Hungry to help connect kids with programs like school breakfast and summer meals, and teach families how to cook healthy, affordable food at home.  In partnership with adidas,<strong>Wanderlust 108</strong>combines three mindful activities &ndash; running, yoga, and meditation &ndash; in your favorite local park. It's a celebration, not a competition, a place to ground yourself so you can rise to even greater heights. Across the full day, you'll finish the three legs of the triathlon, try out something new, like acroyoga, aerial yoga, hooping, or a walking meditation, sample the best flavors in the local food scene, and visit a wide array of local vendors. Most of all, we hope you'll connect with like-minded people in your community. Wanderlust 108 is a mindful movement that's grown to more than 100,000 participants in 17 countries in only a few years. #ComeTogether to spread compassion, give love, and find your true north.  <strong>MISSION 108</strong>  Wanderlust's mission is to help you find your true north &mdash; to cultivate your best self. Wanderlust 108 was created to support that mission at a large scale. With Wanderlust 108, we aim to foster both individual wellness and positive social change by building a large community around mindfulness, including both yoga and meditation. Mindfulness practice has been proven to reduce anxiety, depression and bias, promote a positive body image and improve cognition, but meditation and yoga are seen by many as intimidating or too difficult. Wanderlust 108 shows that practice in a community setting is accessible, affordable and inclusive &ndash; and fun. We are helping to build a global mindful movement, one that will have positive effects on society long after the event is over.  <strong><a href=""https://wanderlust.com/108s/"">Learn More</a></strong>  ",/sites/default/files/styles/partner_sponsor_logos/adidaswllogo.png,,,,,,wanderlust_120x120.jpg,public://wanderlust_120x120.jpg,,,9003,118,118,,
